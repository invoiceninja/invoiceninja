              <p style="padding:10px; color: #DBDBDB;">Demo: https://demo.invoiceninja.com</p>
          </div>

          ## Client Libraries

          PHP SDK can be found [here](https://github.com/invoiceninja/sdk-php)

          ## Authentication:

          Invoice Ninja uses API tokens to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in Settings > Account Management > Integrations > API tokens

          API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made to HTTP will fail.

          ## Errors:

          Invoice Ninja uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. below is a table of standard status codes and responses

          | Status Code | Explanation                                                                 |
          |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
          | 200         | OK: The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request. |
          | 301         | Moved Permanently: This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI. |
          | 303         | See Other: The response to the request can be found under another URI using the GET method. |
          | 400         | Bad Request: The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error. |
          | 401         | Unauthorized: Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. |
          | 403         | Forbidden: The request was valid, but the server is refusing action. |
          | 404         | Not Found: The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. |
          | 405         | Method Not Allowed: A request method is not supported for the requested resource. |
          | 409         | Conflict: Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the request. |
          | 422         | Unprocessable Entity: The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors. |
          | 429         | Too Many Requests: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting"). |
          | 500         | Internal Server Error: A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable. |

          ## Pagination

          When using index routes to retrieve lists of data, by default we limit the number of records returned to 20. You can using standard pagination to paginate results, ie:

        After authenticating with the API, the returned object is a CompanyUser object which is a bridge linking the user to the company. 

        The company user object itself contains the users permissions (admin/owner or fine grained permissions) You will most likely want to 
        also include in the response of this object both the company and the user object, this can be done by using the include parameter.

      description: |
        Matching invoices or a payment to a bank transactions.
        
        The API expects the id of the transaction along with either a comma separated list of invoice ids OR the payment id to associate the transaction to.

        Example for matching a transaction to two invoices:

        {"transactions":[{"id":"olejRl5ejN","invoice_ids":"JxboYBLegw,JxboYBLeXX"}]}

        Example for matching a transaction and a paymente:

        {"transactions":[{"id":"olejRl5ejN","payment_id":"JxboYBLeXf"}]}

        Matching expenses.

        You can match an existing expense within Invoice Ninja - or - create a new expense using the following:

        {"transactions":[{"id":"open5pld7A","vendor_id":"gl9avJnaG1","ninja_category_id":""}]}

        To match to an existing expense:

        {"transactions":[{"id":"Jxbo2qKagw","expense_id":"7N1aMM1aWm"}]}

                      Force sends the recurring invoice - this option is only available when the recurring invoice is in a draft state.  
                    - `restore`  
                      Restores the recurring invoice from an archived or deleted state.
                    - `archive`

                      Deletes a recurring invoice.

              ### Custom Response Description
              This is a custom description for the response returned by the `/example` endpoint.
      description: |
            When retrieving a list of clients you can also chain query parameters in order to filter the dataset that is returned. For example, you can send a request to the following URL to retrieve clients that have a balance greater than 1000:\
              
            ```
            /api/v1/clients?balance=gt:1000
            ``` 
            
            You can also sort the results by adding a sort parameter. The following example will sort the results by the client name in descending order:\
            
            ```
            /api/v1/clients?sort=name|desc
            ```

            You can also combine multiple filters together. The following example will return clients that have a balance greater than 1000 and are not deleted and have a name that starts with "Bob":\
            
            ```
            /api/v1/clients?balance=gt:1000&name=Bob*
            ```

            If you wish to retrieve child relations, you can also combine the query parameter `?include=` with a comma separated list of relationships:\
            
            ```
            /api/v1/clients?include=activities,ledger,system_logs'
            ```

            The per_page and page variables allow pagination of the list of clients. The following example will return the second page of clients with 15 clients per page:\
            
            ```
            /api/v1/clients?per_page=15&page=2
            ```

            The default per_page value is 20.
