.. Note:: The Quotes feature is only available for Pro Plan users.

As a freelancer, many jobs – whether big or small – will begin as a quote. How so? Well, a client expresses interest in your skills or product, but wants to know how much it’s going to cost, in advance. With the Quotes feature of Invoice Ninja, available to Pro Plan users only, you can easily create a price quote and send it to the client up front, helping them make the decision to commit, and helping you keep track of your projected work schedule and income.

Once the price quote is accepted by the client, the Invoice Ninja system enables automatic creation of an invoice that imports all the quote data, so your quotes and invoices are linked, organized and easily traceable. An advanced Invoice Ninja feature, Quotes is truly the cherry on top, giving you maximum functionality from A to Z in your invoicing activity.

To view your Quotes list page, click the Invoices tab on the main taskbar, and select Quotes from the drop-down menu. This will open the Quotes list page.

To create a new quote, go to the Invoices tab on the main taskbar, open the drop-down menu, and click on New Quote. This will open the Quotes / Create page.

How to Create a New Quote

When you open the Quotes / Create page, the Invoice Ninja system will automatically create a new, empty quote for you to complete. Note that the quote entry page is very similar in format to the invoice entry page. This makes converting the quote to an invoice extremely logical and simple.

The top section of the quote contains a range of important information specific to the client and the quote. Let’s explore them one by one:

- **Client**: Click on the arrow at the right end of the Client field. Select the relevant client from the client list. TIP: You can create a new client while creating a new quote. Simply click on the Create new client link, situated below the Client field on the Quotes / Create page. A pop-up window will open, enabling you to complete the new client’s details. Then continue creating the quote for this new client.

  Alternatively, once you’ve selected an existing client from the drop-down client list, you can edit the client or view the client details. Click the Edit Client or View Client links situated directly below the client field. If you click Edit Client, the Edit Client pop-up box will open. If you click View Client, the client summary page will open in a new window.

- **Quote Date**: The date of creation of the quote. Click the calendar icon to select the relevant date.
- **Valid Until**: The last date that the quote is valid and can be accepted by the client. Click the calendar icon to select the relevant date.
- **Partial**: In the event that you will be billing the client for a partial amount of the quote, enter the amount in the Partial field. This will be automatically applied to the quote, and later, to the invoice.
- **Quote #**: The quote number is assigned automatically when you create a new quote, in order of chronology. You can manually override the default quote number by entering a different number in the Quote # field.
- **PO #**: The purchase order number. Enter the purchase order number for easy reference.
- **Discount**: Applying a discount to a quote is the same as applying a discount to an invoice. To learn how to apply a discount, refer to section 5.11 of the User Guide.

.. TIP:: The currency of the quote will be according to the default currency specified for this client when you created the client.

Now that we’ve completed the general quote information, it’s time to finish creating your quote by specifying the job/s you’re billing for, the amounts due for each job/line item, discounts and final balance. Let's explore the various columns of the quote, from left to right along the orange header bar:

- **Item**: This is the name of the item you are quoting for. You can either enter the details manually, or by selecting one of the set items created by you at the Product Settings stage. To select a set item, click on the arrow at the right side of the item bar and choose the relevant item from the drop-down list. To enter the item manually, click inside the field and enter the item. Here are some examples of an item: 1 hour programming services OR 5 pages translation OR 1 hour consulting.
- **Description**: Add more information about the item. This will help the customer better understand the scope of the price quote, and is also useful for your own reference.
- **Unit Cost**: The amount you intend to charge per unit of items. For example, let's say your item is "1 hour consulting", and you charge $80 for an hour of consulting – that is, for 1 item unit. Then you'll enter 80 in the Unit Cost field. Note: If you have selected a set item, the unit cost that you pre-defined at the Product Settings stage will apply by default. You can manually override the default unit cost by clicking in the Unit Cost field and changing the value.
- **Quantity**: The number of units included in the quote. Continuing the above example, let's say you need to quote for 3 hours of consulting, enter the number 3 in the Quantity field.
- **Line Total**: This is the amount quoted for the particular line item. Once you have entered the Unit Cost and Quantity, this figure will be calculated automatically. If you change either value at any time during creation of the quote, the Line Total will adjust accordingly.

.. TIP:: You can enter as many line items as you need in the quote. As soon as you enter any data in a line item, a fresh, blank line item will open in the row below.

Beneath and to the right of the line item section, you'll find the Total value of the quote. It's made up of a number of figures, including Subtotal, Paid to Date and Total:

- **Subtotal**: This is the amount quoted before other payments made to date are included in the quote calculation, such as Partial payments, Credits, etc.
- **Paid to Date**: The amount paid to date towards the value of the quote, including partial payments and credits.
- **Total**: The final value of the quote for the specified job(s), after partial payments and credits have been deducted from the quoted amount.

Directly to the left of the Balance Due section, you'll see a text box with three tabs to choose from:

- **Note to Client**: Want to write a personal or explanatory note to the client? Enter it here.
- **Quote Terms**: Want to set terms to the quote? Enter them here. The terms will appear on the quote. If you want to make these the default terms for all quotes, check the Save as default terms box. Then these terms will automatically appear on each quote you create. Need to change the default terms? Click Reset Terms, and the text box will clear. You can enter new terms or leave blank.
- **Quote Footer**: Want to enter information to appear as a footer on the quote? Enter it here. The text will appear at the bottom of the quote. If you want to make this the default footer for all quotes, check the Save as default footer box. Then this footer will automatically appear on each quote you create. Need to change the default footer? Click Reset footer, and the text box will clear. You can enter a new footer or leave blank.

Below the quote data fields, you'll see a row of colorful buttons, giving you a range of options:

- **Blue button – Download PDF**: Download the quote as a PDF file. You can then print or save to your PC or mobile device.
- **Green button – Save Quote**: Save the last version of the quote. The data is saved in your Invoice Ninja account. You can return to the quote at any   time to continue working on it.
- **Orange button – Email Quote**: Email the quote directly via the Invoice Ninja system to the email address specified for the client.
- **Gray button – More Actions**:

Click on More Actions to open the following action list:

- **Clone Quote**: Duplicate the current quote. Then you can make minor adjustments. This is a fast way to create a new quote that is identical or similar to a previous quote.
- **View History**: You'll be redirected to the Quotes / Quote History page, where you can view a history of all the actions taken from the time the quote was created. The Quote History page displays a copy of the latest version of the quote and a drop-down list of all actions and the corresponding version of the quote. Select the version you wish to view. Click on the blue Edit Quote button at the top right of the page to go back to the quote page.
- **Mark Sent**: When you have sent the quote to your customer, mark as Sent. This will update the quote status in the Quotes list, so you can keep track.
